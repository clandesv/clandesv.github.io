👩🏽‍💻 For the last 3.5 years I have been working as a Quantitative Researcher at the [Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en) at the University of Mannheim.

🏫 I studied Social Sciences and Sociology at the University of Stuttgart and Mannheim. I chose my courses, coursework and thesis within the intersection of survey research, statistics and data science. 

🎓 In April 2024 I earned my PhD in Quantitative Sociology at the Department for Social Data Science and Methodology (UMA). 
  - Thesis Title: "Methods for the Classification of Data from Open-Ended Questions in Surveys"
  - GPA: 1.5 (Magna Cum Laude)
  - 🌰 My PhD in a Nutshell (Disputation Talk): [Methods for the Classification of Data from Open-Ended Questions in Surveys](https://clandesv.github.io/text_classifiers_survey_data/slides.html#/title-slide)

📍 I currently live in Berlin, Germany and soon want to explore another European country.

🔎 I am currently exploring opportunities in Data Analysis and Data Science for my next professional chapter.

Please enjoy exploring my portfolio to learn more about my person and to see a selection of my previous work and projects.
